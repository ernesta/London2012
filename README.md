During the London 2012 games I happened to be doing an internship at Google London. That was definitely a cool coincidence that meant several things:
+ Rent prices skyrocketed
+ I could watch Lithuania play basketball while at work
+ This tiny project happened

Starting wasn't as easy as it should have been - the globe library was rather secretive when it comes to documentation and examples. The most interesting part, though, was probably collecting and matching data (sunny days, anyone?). At the end of the day, however, I just love the way it all looks. It's so pretty!

## Code
All the third-party libraries are housed by `libs`. With the project being a couple of years old already, I'm not even sure it would play nicely with the more recent versions of these libraries. Everything else is rather self-explanatory, really.

## Libraries
A bit of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/). A lot of [WebGL Globe](https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe), [three.js](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/) and [tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js/).
